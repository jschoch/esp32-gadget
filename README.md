# ESP32 Gadget

forked from: https://github.com/volkhin/nixie-timer

Starter code for creating Alexa Gadget
Connects to Alexa using [Alexa Gadgets Toolkit](https://developer.amazon.com/alexa/alexa-gadgets).

This uses btstack to configure EIR and SDP so esp32 can connect.

Currently compiles with the esp-idf 4 preview and 3.2.2
